            <h2>‚ôüÔ∏è Basics</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The game is played by two players.</li>
                <li>Each player has 13 cards, using a quarter deck of playing cards.</li>
                <li>12 cards are placed on the board, and 1 card is designated as the "swap card".</li>
                <li>The cards are arranged in a 3x4 grid randomly (the King must be in the last row), and the opponent's cards are hidden from view.</li>
                <li>Players can move their cards side, forward or diagonally forward (with some special exceptions).</li>
                <li>The objective of the game is to either capture the opponent's king or move your own king to the opponent's backline.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üéÆ Gameplay</h2>
            <p>In each turn, a player can choose one of the following actions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p><strong>Move a card:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you move onto an opponent's card, both the card you moved and the card you landed on are revealed.</li>
                        <li>If your card is higher in rank than the opponent's, you successfully capture their card, and it is removed from the game. You replace their card with your own.</li>
                        <li>If your card is lower in rank, your card is captured and removed from the game, while the opponent's card remains face-up on the board.</li>
                        <li><strong>Important note</strong>: To capture a king, it can only be defeated by a <em>face card</em> (Jack, Queen, or King) or a <em>Ten</em>. <em>Aces cannot capture the King</em>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Swap two adjacent cards:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can exchange the position of two adjacent cards on the board.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Swap a card with the "swap card":</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can replace one of your cards (except the King) with the swap card on the board.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>After your turn, the next player takes their turn.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>‚¨ÜÔ∏è Promotion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p>If you reach the opponent's backline with a card, you can exchange it to a captured one.</p></li>
                <li><p>If there is no captured card yet, the same card will be promoted.</p></li>
                <li><p>The promoted card is placed at the first blank space in the column.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h2>üÉè Special Cards</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>üí£ Mine (Ace):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When a mine is stepped on, it explodes, causing both the stepping card and the mine to be removed from the game.</li>
                        <li>The mine itself can move, but it cannot step on an opponent's card.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>üõ°Ô∏è Shield (Two):</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If a card steps on a Shield, the attack is deflected, and the Shield stays in place. However, in the next turn, the Shield can be captured by a higher-ranked card.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>‚öîÔ∏è Jack:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Jack card cannot attack diagonally. However, it can move forward, even jumping over one of the cards directly in front of it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>üëë Queen:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Queen can only attack diagonally.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, it can reveal the first unflipped enemy card in front of it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
